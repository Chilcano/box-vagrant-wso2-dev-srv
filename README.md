# Vagrant WSO2 Development Server Box

> This Vagrant box was the older [box-vagrant-wso2-dev-srv](https://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/creating-a-vm-with-wso2-servers-for-development).
> I have removed the rTail Puppet modules to create a new rTail server Docker Container.
> The older GitHub repository for [box-vagrant-wso2-dev-srv](https://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/creating-a-vm-with-wso2-servers-for-development) will not be updated.
> I recommend you using this new one, more lightweight and flexible.
